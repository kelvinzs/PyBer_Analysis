# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of Project 
Using Pandas, python and relevant resources, wrangle/clean provided data for analysis. Deliverable for the project include: 
1) A ride sharing summary dataFrame by City type.
2) A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
3) A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

Resources:City_data.csv, Ride_data.csv, pyber_ride_data.csv
Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python 

#Results: 
Results from the analysis performed shows that Rural cities recorded the lowest number of completed rides(125) when compared to suburban (625) and Urban (1625) 

Results from the analysis performed shows that Rural cities recorded the lowest number of available drivers with (78) when compared to suburban (490) and Urban (2405) 
 
 Comparison for Average fare per ride and average per driver, along with previously mentioned results posted in table below.

Summary 
In conclusion Rural cities drivers earn higher fees/fares due to either an increased demand for rides or a lack of supply for drivers as also it recorded the least amount of drivers. Would reccomend boosting the supply of drivers to drive down price and increase market share. 

Urban cities are over-saturated with drivers and this is inturn driving down the price rides thus making pyber not as profitable for Urban drivers as it is for rural drivers. I would reccomend decreasing total number of drivers in Urban regions to drive up price.
